/*
This is lib.h; it's the include file for lib.cpp
It should include no code at all (except in one case)
that we'll look at in the end of the semester
but only declarations like function signatures
One signature for each functino in the .cpp file
  - In this case, lib.cpp has 1 function, so there is only 1 signature here
